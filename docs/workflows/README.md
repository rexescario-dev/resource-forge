# Engineering workflow

Governing contract: [Process Specification: Standardized Agent Workflows](specs/agent-workflow-design.md) · Conventions: [prompt-library.md](conventions/prompt-library.md)

This directory holds a **published** engineering workflow for AI agents and humans: stage prompts, conventions, and the process contract. It is intended to be used as ordinary repository documentation under `docs/workflows/`.

## How to use

1. Read the [process specification](specs/agent-workflow-design.md) for stages, gates, and invariants.
2. Follow [prompt-library conventions](conventions/prompt-library.md) when invoking or extending prompts.
3. Open the stage prompt that matches the work you are doing (table below).

## Stage → prompt map

| M3 Design Review | [prompts/design-review.md](prompts/design-review.md) |
| M4 Implementation Planning | [prompts/implementation-planning.md](prompts/implementation-planning.md) |
| M5 Plan Review | [prompts/plan-review.md](prompts/plan-review.md) |

Operational installer state (if present) lives in repository-root `workflow.yaml`, outside this tree.
